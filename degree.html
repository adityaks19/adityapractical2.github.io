                    Hostel has been a great memory for every hostler and that is best part of your college life. The night-outs, parties, having multiple rounds tea during exams and the most important birthday bash.

                    I can't tell you much you would enjoy the fest, having fun with your friends dancing making the best memories of the college life. The fest is a stress buster and takes all the load off you and forget the tension for 2-3 days and just enjoy with your
                    classmates.
